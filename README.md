# react-express-generator

## Introduction

This project is a template generator CLI tool that allows you to quickly scaffold out new projects based on predefined templates. It simplifies the process of setting up project structures and includes features for generating both server-side and client-side code. Whether you need a server-only, client-only, or a combination of both, this tool can help you get started with ease.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To use this project generator, you need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. If you don't have them, you can download and install them from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

You can install the project generator globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g project-generator
```

### Usage

Once installed, you can use the `project-generator` command to create new projects. Here are some basic usage examples:

```bash
# Create a client-only project
project-generator

# Create a server-only project
project-generator --server

# Create a project with authentication
project-generator --auth
```

By default, the generator will prompt you for project details like the name, type, and whether to include a "src" directory.
